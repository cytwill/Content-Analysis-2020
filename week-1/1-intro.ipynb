      "ABSTRACT Cyberbullying is a growing problem affecting more than half of all American teens. The main goal of this paper is to in- vestigate fundamentally new approaches to understand and automatically detect and predict incidents of cyberbullying in Instagram, a media-based mobile social network. In this work, we have collected a sample data set consisting of In- stagram images and their associated comments. We then de- signed a labeling study and employed human contributors at the crowd-sourced CrowdFlower website to label these me- dia sessions for cyberbullying. A detailed analysis of the labeled data is then presented, including a study of relation- ships between cyberbullying and a host of features such as cyberaggression, profanity, social graph features, temporal commenting behavior, linguistic content, and image content. Using the labeled data, we further design and evaluate the performance of classiﬁers to automatically detect and pre- dict incidents of cyberbullying and cyberaggression.
